Welcome to Maze Generation Visualizer! I built this application that can be used to generate mazes because they interest me, and I couldn't find a visualizer that showed them off. You can access it here (works best with Google Chrome): https://jiggles4life1.github.io/MazeGenerationVisulizer/

Algorithms currently implemented:
  
  Kruskal
  
  Depth-First Search
  
  Prim
  
  Wilson

 More to Come!
